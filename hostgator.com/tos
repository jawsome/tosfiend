			<p>These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) are an agreement between HostGator.com, LLC ("HostGator" or “us” or “our”) and you (“User” or “you” or “your”).  This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the products and services made available by HostGator and of the HostGator.com website (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Agreement, you are not authorized to use or access the Services.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Additional Policies and Agreements</strong>
					<ol class="alpha">
						<li>
							Use of the Services is also governed by the following policies, which are incorporated by reference. By using the Services, you also agree to the terms of the following policies.

								<li><a href="/copyright" title="Sample Copyright Complaint Steps">Copyright Infringement Policy</a></li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Additional terms may also apply to certain Services, and are incorporated by reference herein as applicable.  For example, if you register a domain name with us, then the Domain Registration Agreement will also apply to you and would be incorporated herein.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Account Eligibility</strong>
					<ol class="alpha">
						<li>
							By registering for or using the Services, you represent and warrant that:
							<ol class="lower-roman">
								<li>You are eighteen (18) years of age or older.  The Services are intended solely for Users who are eighteen (18) years of age or older. Any registration, use of or access to the Services, by anyone under eighteen (18) is unauthorized and is a violation of this Agreement.</li>
								<li>If you use the Services on behalf of another party you agree that you are authorized to bind such other party to this Agreement and to act on such other party’s behalf with respect to any actions you take in connection with the Services.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>It is your responsibility to provide accurate, current, and complete information on the registration forms, including an email address that is different from the domain you are signing up under. If there is ever an abuse issue or we need to contact you, we will use the primary email address we have on file. It is your responsibility to ensure that the contact information for your account, including any domain accounts is accurate, correct and complete at all times. HostGator is not responsible for any lapse in the Services, including without limitation, any lapsed domain registrations due to outdated contact information being associated with the domain. If you need to verify or change your contact information, please contact our sales team via email or update your contact information through the HostGator Billing and Support System. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. In dedicated server purchases or certain other cases, you may be required to provide government issued identification and possibly a scan of the credit card used for verification purposes. Failure to provide the information requested may result in your order being denied.</li>
						<li>You agree to be fully responsible for all use of your account and for any actions that take place through your account.  It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password and other information related to the security of your account.</li>
						<li>Any dedicated IP order in addition to those provided with a hosting package may be subject to IP justification.  IP justification practices are subject to change to remain in compliance with the policies of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). We reserve the right to deny any dedicated IP request based on insufficient justification or current IP utilization.</li>
					</ol>

				<li>
					<strong>Transfers</strong>
					<br />Our Transfers Team will make every effort to help you move your website to us. Transfers are provided as a courtesy service.  We do not make any guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to migrate some or all account data.  In some cases we may not be able to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host. The free transfer service is available for thirty (30) days from your sign up date. Transfers outside of the thirty (30) day period will incur a charge; please contact a member of our Transfers department to receive a price quote.  In no event shall HostGator be held liable for any lost or missing data or files resulting from a transfer to or from HostGator. <strong>You are solely responsible for backing up your data in all circumstances.</strong>

				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Account Security and HostGator Systems.</strong>
					<ol class="alpha">
						<li>It is your responsibility to ensure that scripts/programs installed under your account are secure and permissions of directories are set properly, regardless of the installation method. When at all possible, set permissions on most directories to 755 or as restrictive as possible. Users are ultimately responsible for all actions taken under their account. This includes the compromise of credentials such as user name and password. You are required to use a secure password. If a weak password is used, your account may be suspended until you agree to use a more secure password. Audits may be done to prevent weak passwords from being used. If an audit is performed, and your password is found to be weak, we will notify you and allow time for you to change or update your password before suspending your account.</li>
						<li>The Services, including all related equipment, networks and network devices are provided only for authorized customer use. HostGator may, but is not obligated to, monitor our systems, including without limitation, to ensure that use is authorized, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied and used for authorized purposes. By using the Services, you consent to monitoring for these purposes.</li>
						<li>Any account found connecting to a third party network or system without authorization from the third party is subject to suspension. Access to networks or systems outside of your direct control requires the express written consent of the third party. HostGator may, at our discretion, request documentation to prove that your access to a third party network or system is authorized.</li>
						<li>Any account that is found to be compromised may be disabled and/or terminated. If you do not clean up your account after being notified by HostGator of an ongoing issue, we reserve the right to keep your account disabled. Upon your request, HostGator may clean-up your account for an additional fee.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>HIPAA Disclaimer.</strong> We are not "HIPAA compliant."
					<br />You are solely responsible for any applicable compliance with federal or state laws governing the privacy and security of personal data, including medical or other sensitive data. You acknowledge that the Services may not be appropriate for the storage or control of access to sensitive data, such as information about children or medical or health information. HostGator does not control or monitor the information or data you store on, or transmit through, the Services. We specifically disclaim any representation or warranty that the Services, as offered, comply with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Customers requiring secure storage of “protected health information” as defined under HIPAA are expressly prohibited from using the Services for such purposes. Storing and permitting access to “protected health information” is a material violation of this Agreement, and grounds for immediate account termination. We do not sign “Business Associate Agreements” and you agree that HostGator is not a Business Associate or subcontractor or agent of yours pursuant to HIPAA. If you have questions about the security of your data, you should contact <a href="mailto:feedback@hostgator.com">feedback@hostgator.com</a>.

					<strong>Billing and Payment Information</strong>
					<ol class="alpha">
						<li>
							<strong>Prepayment.</strong>
							<br />It is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date, and that all invoices are paid on time.

Subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations, payments received will be first applied to the oldest outstanding invoice in your billing account.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Autorenewal.</strong>
							<br />Unless otherwise provided, you agree that until and unless you notify HostGator of your desire to cancel the Services, you will be billed on an automatically recurring basis to prevent any disruption to your Services, using your credit card or other billing information on file with us.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Taxes.</strong>
							<br />Listed fees for the Services do not include any applicable sales, use, revenue, excise or other taxes imposed by any taxing authority.

						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Late Payment.</strong>
							<br />All invoices must be paid within ten (10) days of the invoice due date. Any invoice that is outstanding for more than ten (10) days may result in the suspension or termination of Services. Access to the account will not be restored until payment has been received.  If you fail to pay the fees as specified herein, HostGator may suspend or terminate your account and pursue the collection costs incurred by HostGator, including without limitation, any arbitration and legal fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees. HostGator will not activate new orders or activate new packages for customers who have an outstanding balance on their account.
							<br /><strong>Dedicated servers are subject to being reclaimed and all content deleted if you fail to make a timely payment.  If you make a late payment we do not automatically reactivate the dedicated servers.  Contact HostGator directly after you make a late payment to reactivate the dedicated server.</strong>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Domain Payments.</strong>
							<br />It is solely your responsibility to notify HostGator’s Billing department via a support ticket created from <a href="http://support.hostgator.com" target="_blank">http://support.hostgator.com</a> after purchasing a domain. Domain renewal notices are provided as a courtesy reminder and HostGator is not responsible for a failure to renew a domain or a failure to notify a customer about a domain's renewal.  Domain renewals are billed and renewed thirty (30) days before the renew date.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Fraud.</strong>
							<br />It is a violation of this Agreement for you to misuse or fraudulently use credit cards, charge cards, electronic funds transfers, electronic checks, or any other payment method. HostGator may report any such misuse or fraudulent use, as determined in HostGator’s sole discretion, to governmental and law enforcement authorities, credit reporting services, financial institutions and/or credit card companies.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Invoice Disputes.</strong>
							<br />You have ninety (90) days to dispute any charge or payment processed by HostGator. If you have any questions concerning a charge on your account, our billing department directly for assistance.

				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Money-back Guarantee</strong>
					<ol class="alpha">
						<li>
							<strong>Dedicated Servers.</strong>
							<br /><u>There are no refunds on dedicated servers. The forty-five (45) day money- back guarantee does not apply to dedicated servers.</u>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Managed shared, VPS and Reseller Services.</strong>
							<br />HostGator offers a forty-five (45) day money- back guarantee for HostGator's managed shared, VPS, and reseller hosting services only.  Subject to the terms described in Section 13 below, if you are not completely satisfied with these hosting services and you terminate your account  within forty-five (45) days of signing up for the Services, you will be given a full refund of the amount paid for hosting. This money-back guarantee only applies to fees paid for hosting services and does not apply to administrative fees, install fees for custom software or other setup fees, or to any fees for any other additional services.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Cancellations and Refunds</strong>
					<ol class="alpha">
						<li>
							<strong>Payment Method.</strong>
							<br />No refunds will be provided <u>if you use any of the following methods of payment: bank wire transfers, Western Union payments, checks and money orders. If you use any of these payment methods, any applicable credit will be posted to your hosting account instead of a refund</u>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Money-back Guarantee.</strong>
							<br />If an account with a forty-five (45) day money-back guarantee is purchased and then cancelled within the first forty-five (45) days of the beginning of the term (the “Money-Back Guarantee Period”), you will, upon your written request to the HostGator Support Team (the “Refund Request”) within ninety (90) days of such termination or cancellation (“Notice Period”), receive a full refund of all basic shared, VPS and reseller hosting fees previously paid by you to HostGator for the initial term (“Money-Back Guarantee Refund”); provided that such Money-Back Guarantee Refund shall be due to you only upon your compliance with, and subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of, this Section 13. Requests for these refunds must be made in writing to the HostGator Support Team. Refunds will only be issued for basic shared, VPS and reseller hosting services and will not include administrative fees, install fees for custom software or other setup fees, nor will they include any fees for any other additional services.  Money Back Guarantee Refunds will not accrue, and shall not be paid under any circumstances, if you do not provide the applicable Refund Request within the Notice Period.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Refund Eligibility.</strong>
							<br />Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you've had an account with us before, canceled and signed up again, or if you have opened a second account with us, you will not be eligible for a refund. <strong>Violations of this Agreement will waive your rights under the refund policy.</strong>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Non-refundable Products and Services.</strong>
							<br />There are no refunds on dedicated servers, administrative fees, and install fees for custom software. Please note that domain refunds will only be considered if the domain was ordered in conjunction with a hosting package and will be issued at HostGator’s sole discretion. Any refunds issued for domain names will be reduced by the market value of the gTLD. Purchases of ccTLDs are non-refundable.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cancellation Process.</strong>
							<br />You may terminate or cancel the Services  by giving HostGator written notice via the <a href="/cancel" title="Cancellation Form">cancellation</a> form provided. In such event: (i) you shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of such cancellation and (ii) HostGator may, in our sole discretion, refund all pre-paid fees for basic hosting services for the full months remaining after the effectiveness of such cancellation (i.e. no partial month fees shall be refunded) less any setup fees, applicable taxes and any discount applied for prepayment, provided that you are not in breach of this Agreement.
							<hr />Once we receive your cancellation form and have confirmed all necessary information with you via email, we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been canceled. Your cancellation confirmation will contain a ticket/tracking number in the subject line for your reference and for verification purposes. You should immediately receive an automatic email with a tracking number stating that "Your request has been received...." HostGator will confirm your request and process your cancellation shortly thereafter. If you do not hear back from us, or do not receive the automatic confirmation email within a few minutes after submitting your cancellation form, please contact us immediately via <span><div class="phone-tool-tip">1.866.964.2867</div>phone</span>. We require all cancellations to be done through the online form in order to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing that you are prepared for all of your files and emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process aims to reduce the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and to ensure that you are aware that your files, emails, and account may be removed immediately and permanently after a cancellation request is processed.
							<hr />Cancellations for shared and reseller accounts will be effective on the account’s renewal date.  Cancellations for dedicated and VPS accounts will be effective immediately.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Domains.</strong>
							<br />Domain renewals are billed and renewed thirty (30) days before the renewal date.  It is your responsibility to notify HostGator’s Billing department via a support ticket created from <a href="http://support.hostgator.com" title="Support Portal">http://support.hostgator.com</a> to cancel any domain registration <u>at least thirty (30) days prior to the renewal date</u>. No refunds will be given once a domain is renewed.  All domain registrations and renewals are final.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Foreign Currencies.</strong>
							<br />Exchange rate fluctuations for international payments are constant and unavoidable. All refunds are processed in U.S. dollars and will reflect the exchange rate in effect on the date of the refund. All refunds are subject to this fluctuation and HostGator is not responsible for any change in exchange rates between the time of payment and the time of refund.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Termination</strong>
							<br />HostGator may terminate your access to the Services, in whole or in part, without notice in the event that: (i) you fail to pay any fees due; (ii) you violate this Agreement; (iii) your conduct may harm HostGator or others or cause HostGator or others to incur liability, as determined by HostGator in our sole discretion; or (iv) as otherwise specified in this Agreement. In such event, HostGator shall not refund to you any fees paid in advance of such termination, and you shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of such termination.  Additionally, HostGator may charge you for all fees due for the Services for the remaining portion of the then current term.
							<br /><strong>UPON TERMINATION OF THE SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, USER CONTENT, USER WEBSITES, AND OTHER DATA WILL BE DELETED.</strong>

					<strong>CPU, Bandwidth and Disk Usage</strong>
					<ol class="alpha">
						<li>
							<strong>Permitted CPU and Disk Usage.</strong>
							<br />All use of hosting space provided by HostGator is subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Acceptable Use Policy.
							<ol class="lower-roman">
								<li>Shared hosting space may only be used for web files, active email and content of User Websites. Shared hosting space may not be used for storage (whether of media, emails, or other data), including, as offsite storage of electronic files, email or FTP hosts. HostGator expressly reserves the right to review every shared account for excessive usage of CPU, disk space and other resources that may be caused by a violation of this Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policy. HostGator may, in our sole discretion, terminate access to the Services, apply additional fees, or remove or delete User Content for those accounts that are found to be in violation of HostGator’s terms and conditions.</li>
								<li>Dedicated and VPS usage is limited by the resources allocated to the specific plan that you have purchased.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Bandwidth Usage.</strong>
							<br />Shared servers are not limited in their bandwidth allowance.  Unlimited bandwidth usage is not available for resellers, dedicated or VPS servers, which are subject to the terms of the plan you purchased and can be viewed in your control panel.

					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Uptime Guarantee.</strong>
					<br />If your shared or reseller server has a physical downtime that falls short of the 99.9% uptime guarantee, you may receive one (1) month of credit on your account. This uptime guarantee does not apply to planned maintenance. Approval of any credit is at the sole discretion of HostGator and may be dependent upon the justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor's network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services. To request a credit, please visit <a href="http://support.hostgator.com" title="Support Portal">http://support.hostgator.com</a> to create a support ticket to our Billing department with justification. Uptime guarantees only apply to shared and reseller solutions. Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in which the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is down which is not related to our uptime guarantee.

				<li>
					<strong>Reseller Terms and Client Responsibility</strong>
					<ol class="alpha">
						<li>Resellers shall ensure that each of their clients complies with this Agreement.</li>
						<li>Resellers are responsible for supporting their clients. HostGator does not provide support to clients of HostGator’s resellers. If a reseller’s client contacts HostGator, HostGator reserves the right to place a reseller client account on hold until the reseller can assume responsibility for the reseller’s client. All support requests must be made by the reseller on its client's behalf for security purposes.</li>
						<li>Resellers are also responsible for all content stored or transmitted under their reseller account and the actions of their clients. HostGator will hold any reseller responsible for any of their client’s actions that violate the law or this Agreement.</li>
						<li>HostGator is not responsible for the acts or omissions of our resellers. The reseller hereby agrees to indemnify HostGator from and against any and all claims made by any User arising from the reseller's acts or omissions.</li>
						<li>HostGator reserves the right to revise our Reseller Program at any time. Changes shall take effect when posted online or on any subsequent date as may be set forth by HostGator.</li>
						<li>Resellers in the HostGator Reseller Program assume all responsibility for billing and technical support for each of the Users signed up by the reseller.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Shared (non-reseller accounts)</strong>
					<br />Shared accounts may not be used to resell web hosting to others. If you wish to resell hosting you must use a reseller account.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Dedicated Servers</strong>
					<br />HostGator reserves the right to reset the password on a dedicated server if the password on file is not current so that we may do security audits as required by our datacenter. It is your responsibility to ensure that there is a valid email address and current root password on file for your dedicated server to prevent downtime from forced password resets. HostGator reserves the right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative actions at the request of our datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us. It is your responsibility to maintain backups.  Dedicated servers that have invoices outstanding for more than ten (10) days may be subject to deletion which will result in the loss of all data on the server.  HostGator will not be liable for any loss of data resulting from such deletion.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Price Change</strong>
					<br />HostGator reserves the right to change prices, the monthly payment amount, or any other charges at any time. We will provide you with at least thirty (30) days’ notice before charging you with any price change. It is your sole responsibility to periodically review billing information provided by HostGator through the user billing tool or through other methods of communication, including notices sent or posted by HostGator.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Coupons</strong>
					<br />Discounts and coupon codes are reserved for first-time accounts or first-time customers only and may not be used towards the purchase of a domain registration unless otherwise specified. If you have previously signed up using a particular domain, you may not sign up again for that domain using another coupon at a later date. Any account found in violation of these policies will be reviewed by our Sales department and the appropriate charges will be added to the account. Coupon abuse will not be tolerated and may result in the suspension or termination of your account. All coupons and discounts are only valid towards the initial purchase and do not affect the renewal or recurring price.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
					<br />IN NO EVENT WILL HOSTGATOR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY USER CONTENT, USER WEBSITES OR OTHER MATERIALS ACCESSED OR DOWNLOADED THROUGH THE SERVICES, EVEN IF HOSTGATOR IS AWARE OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, HOSTGATOR'S LIABILITY TO YOU, OR ANY PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU, FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO HOSTGATOR FOR THE SERVICES IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.  THIS IS AN AGGREGATE LIMIT.  THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM HEREUNDER WILL NOT INCREASE THIS LIMIT.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Indemnification</strong>
					<br />You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless HostGator, our affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, suits, actions, demands, proceedings (whether legal or administrative), and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees) threatened, asserted, or filed by a third party against any of the Indemnified Parties arising out of or relating to (i) your use of the Services, (ii) any breach or violation by you of this Agreement; or (iii) any acts or omissions by you. The terms of this section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Arbitration</strong>
					<br />By using the Services, you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of this Agreement.  The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator chosen by HostGator and will be held at the AAA location chosen by HostGator in Texas. Payment of all filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph.  In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, HostGator will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.  The arbitration before the AAA shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others.  The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this paragraph.  All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final. The arbitrator's award is final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator’s authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and HostGator alone.  Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties.  No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. If you initiate litigation or any other proceeding against HostGator in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay HostGator’s reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with our enforcement of this paragraph.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Independent Contractor</strong>
					<br />HostGator and User are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement places HostGator and User in the relationship of principal and agent, partners or joint venturers. Neither party has, expressly or by implication, or may represent itself as having, any authority to make contracts or enter into any agreements in the name of the other party, or to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Governing Law; Jurisdiction</strong>
					<br />Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the formation of this Agreement or the breach of this Agreement, including any claim based upon an alleged tort, shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of Texas. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Disclaimer</strong>
					<br />HostGator shall not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer. HostGator makes no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied for the Services. HostGator disclaims any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, including loss of data resulting from delays, delivery failures, wrong deliveries, and any and all service interruptions caused by HostGator or our employees.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Backups and Data Loss</strong>
					<br />Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. HostGator’s backup service runs once a week and overwrites any of our previous backups. Only one week of backups are kept at a time. This service is provided only to shared and reseller accounts as a courtesy and may be modified or terminated at any time at HostGator’s sole discretion. HostGator does not maintain backups of dedicated accounts. HostGator is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You agree to take full responsibility for all files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backup of files and data stored on HostGator’s servers.
					<hr />Any shared account using more than 20 gigs of disk space will be removed from our off site weekly backup with the exception of databases continuing to be backed up. All data will continue to be mirrored to a secondary drive to help protect against data loss in the event of a drive failure.

				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Waiver</strong>
					<br />No failure or delay by you or HostGator to exercise any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of any right or remedy. No express waiver of, or assent  to, any breach of or default in any term or condition of this Agreement by any party hereto shall constitute a waiver of, or an assent to, any succeeding breach of or default in the same or any other term or condition hereof.

					<strong>Assignment; Successors</strong>
					<br />You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of HostGator.

				<li>
					<strong>Force Majeure</strong>
					<br />Neither party is liable for any default or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than failure to make payments when due) if such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by forces beyond such party's reasonable control, including, without limitation, fire, flood, acts of God, labor disputes, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, interruptions of transportation or communications, supply shortages or the failure of any third party to perform any commitment relative to the production or delivery of any equipment or material required for such party to perform its obligations hereunder.
