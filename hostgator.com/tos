					<strong>Transfers</strong>
					<br>Our Transfers Team will make every effort to help you move your website to us. Transfers are provided as a courtesy service.  We do not make any guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to migrate some or all account data.  In some cases we may not be able to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host. The free transfer service is available for thirty (30) days from your sign up date. Transfers outside of the thirty (30) day period will incur a charge; please contact a member of our Transfers department to receive a price quote.

If a weak password is used, your account may be suspended until you agree to use a more secure password. Audits may be done to prevent weak passwords from being used. If an audit is performed, and your password is found to be weak, we will notify you and allow time for you to change or update your password before suspending your account.</li>

We require all cancellations to be done through the online form in order to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing that you are prepared for all of your files and emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process aims to reduce the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and to ensure that you are aware that your files, emails, and account may be removed immediately and permanently after a cancellation request is processed.

					<strong>Dedicated Servers</strong>
					<br>HostGator reserves the right to reset the password on a dedicated server if the password on file is not current so that we may do security audits as required by our datacenter. It is your responsibility to ensure that there is a valid email address and current root password on file for your dedicated server to prevent downtime from forced password resets. HostGator reserves the right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative actions at the request of our datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us. It is your responsibility to maintain backups.  Dedicated servers that have invoices outstanding for more than ten (10) days may be subject to deletion which will result in the loss of all data on the server.  HostGator will not be liable for any loss of data resulting from such deletion.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Price Change</strong>
					<br>HostGator reserves the right to change prices, the monthly payment amount, or any other charges at any time. We will provide you with at least thirty (30) days&#x2019; notice before charging you with any price change. It is your sole responsibility to periodically review billing information provided by HostGator through the user billing tool or through other methods of communication, including notices sent or posted by HostGator.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Coupons</strong>
					<br>Discounts and coupon codes are reserved for first-time accounts or first-time customers only and may not be used towards the purchase of a domain registration unless otherwise specified. If you have previously signed up using a particular domain, you may not sign up again for that domain using another coupon at a later date. Any account found in violation of these policies will be reviewed by our Sales department and the appropriate charges will be added to the account. Coupon abuse will not be tolerated and may result in the suspension or termination of your account. All coupons and discounts are only valid towards the initial purchase and do not affect the renewal or recurring price.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
					<br>IN NO EVENT WILL HOSTGATOR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY USER CONTENT, USER WEBSITES OR OTHER MATERIALS ACCESSED OR DOWNLOADED THROUGH THE SERVICES, EVEN IF HOSTGATOR IS AWARE OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, HOSTGATOR&apos;S LIABILITY TO YOU, OR ANY PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU, FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO HOSTGATOR FOR THE SERVICES IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.  THIS IS AN AGGREGATE LIMIT.  THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM HEREUNDER WILL NOT INCREASE THIS LIMIT.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Indemnification</strong>
					<br>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless HostGator, our affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an &quot;Indemnified Party&quot; and, collectively, the &quot;Indemnified Parties&quot;) from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, suits, actions, demands, proceedings (whether legal or administrative), and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney&apos;s fees) threatened, asserted, or filed by a third party against any of the Indemnified Parties arising out of or relating to (i) your use of the Services, (ii) any breach or violation by you of this Agreement; or (iii) any acts or omissions by you. The terms of this section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Arbitration</strong>
					<br>By using the Services, you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association (&#x201C;AAA&#x201D;) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of this Agreement.  The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator chosen by HostGator and will be held at the AAA location chosen by HostGator in Texas. Payment of all filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#x2019;s rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph.  In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, HostGator will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.  The arbitration before the AAA shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others.  The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this paragraph.  All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final. The arbitrator&apos;s award is final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator&#x2019;s authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and HostGator alone.  Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties.  No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. If you initiate litigation or any other proceeding against HostGator in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay HostGator&#x2019;s reasonable costs and attorneys&#x2019; fees incurred in connection with our enforcement of this paragraph.

					<strong>Backups and Data Loss</strong>
					<br>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. HostGator&#x2019;s backup service runs once a week and overwrites any of our previous backups. Only one week of backups are kept at a time. This service is provided only to shared and reseller accounts as a courtesy and may be modified or terminated at any time at HostGator&#x2019;s sole discretion. HostGator does not maintain backups of dedicated accounts. HostGator is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You agree to take full responsibility for all files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backup of files and data stored on HostGator&#x2019;s servers.
					<hr>Any shared account using more than 20 gigs of disk space will be removed from our off site weekly backup with the exception of databases continuing to be backed up. All data will continue to be mirrored to a secondary drive to help protect against data loss in the event of a drive failure.
