## VPS Terms of Service

The use of services from HostGator.com, LLC \[hereafter referred to as "HostGator"\] constitutes agreement to these terms. You may view our [Privacy Policy here][0].

**1.) Cancellations and Refunds**
  
Any abuse of our staff in any medium or format will result in the suspension or termination of your services.

Customers may cancel at any time via a [cancellation form][1]. HostGator gives you an unconditional 45 day money back guarantee on Virtual Private Servers for any customer who paid the first invoice with a credit card or with Paypal.

Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you've had an account with us before, canceled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if you have opened a second account with us.

The following methods of payments are non-refundable, and refunds will be posted as credit to the hosting account:

* Bank Wire Transfers
* Western Union Payments
* Checks
* Money orders

**2.) Resource Usage Limits**
  
VPS accounts may not:
  
a) exceed a 15 minute load average greater than two (2) times the amount of CPU cores given.
  
b) run public IRCd's or malicious bots.
  
c) run any type of BitTorrent client or tracker that links to or downloads illegal content.
  
d) use an Open/Public proxy, or utilize a proxy to access illegal/malicious content.
  
e) use I/O intensive applications which adversely affect normal server operations.
  

**3.) Inodes**
  
VPS accounts come with a default inode limit of 1,000,000 to better protect the file system. The limit can be increased if there is a legitimate reason to have it increased. To make a request, please email our support team.

**4.) Mail Policy**
  
VPS accounts will be governed by our dedicated server mail policy, which is available at [Dedicated server mail policy][2].

**5.) Backup and Data Loss**
  
Your use of this service is at your sole risk. Our backup service is provided to you as a courtesy. HostGator is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You agree to take full responsibility for files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backup of files and data stored on HostGator servers. Backups will not be provided for accounts that have been suspended or terminated for any reason unless otherwise agreed to in writing by HostGator.

**6) Uptime Guarantee**
  
Approval of any credit is at the discretion of HostGator dependent upon justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor's network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services. To request a credit, please visit [http://support.hostgator.com][3] to create a support ticket to our Billing department with proper justification. The 99.9% up time guarantee only applies to shared/reseller solutions. Dedicated and VPS servers are covered by a network guarantee in which the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is down, which is not related to our uptime guarantee.
