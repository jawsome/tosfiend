Accordingly, you understand and agree to use the Service solely for the purpose of hosting and serving web pages as viewed through a web browser or other application and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) protocol or other equivalent technology. CloudFlare's Service is also a shared web caching service, which means a number of customers' websites are cached from the same server. To ensure that CloudFlare's Service is reliable and available for the greatest number of users, a customer's usage cannot adversely affect the performance of other customers' sites. Additionally, the purpose of CloudFlare's Service is to proxy web content, not store data.

You further agree that if, at CloudFlare's sole discretion, you are deemed to have violated this section, or if CloudFlare, in its sole discretion, deems it necessary due to excessive burden or potential adverse impact on CloudFlare's systems, potential adverse impact on other users, server processing power, server memory, abuse controls, or other reasons, CloudFlare may suspend or terminate your account without notice to or liability to you.

CloudFlare reserves the right to investigate you, your business, and/or your owners, officers, directors, managers, and other principals, your sites, and the materials comprising the sites at any time. These investigations will be conducted solely for CloudFlare's benefit, and not for your benefit or that of any third party. If the investigation reveals any information, act, or omission, which in CloudFlare's sole opinion, constitutes a violation of any local, state, federal, or foreign law or regulation, this Agreement, or is otherwise deemed harm the Service, CloudFlare may immediately shut down your access to the Service. You agree to waive any cause of action or claim you may have against CloudFlare for such action, including but not limited to any disruption to your website. You acknowledge that CloudFlare may, at its own discretion, reveal the information about your web server to alleged copyright holders or other complaintants who have filed complaints with us.

### SECTION 12: INDEMNITY

You agree to indemnify and hold CloudFlare, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of the Terms of Service, or your violation of any rights of another.

### SECTION 15: DMCA & ABUSE REPORTS

CloudFlare is a pass-through network and, at most, caches content for a limited period in order to improve network performance. CloudFlare automatically removes content from our caches when it has been removed from our customer's origin web server. CloudFlare is not a hosting provider and has no way of removing abusive content on third party hosting services. Individuals or copyright holders concerned with content served through CloudFlare's network may submit a complaint for investigation to: [https://www.cloudflare.com/abuse][0].

CloudFlare does not accept abuse complaints submitted over the telephone. If you would prefer not to use our complaint submission form, you may mail your complaint to:

CloudFlare, Inc.  
Attn: Abuse Department  
665 3rd Street, Suite 200  
San Francisco, CA 94107

Please provide detailed information supporting your complaint as well as an affidavit attesting to its validity.

By submitting a complaint, you acknowledge that, at CloudFlare's sole discretion, copies of the complaint may be provided to the CloudFlare user, the user's hosting provider, posted on CloudFlare's website, and/or provided to third party services such as [ChillingEffects.org][1].

### SECTION 17: LINKS

The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other websites or resources. Because CloudFlare has no control over such sites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that CloudFlare is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that CloudFlare shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content.

### SECTION 18: PUBLICITY

### SECTION 19: NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES

You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Terms of Service, there shall be no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.

### SECTION 20: WAIVER

The failure of CloudFlare to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.

### SECTION 21: SEVERABILITY OF TERMS

If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.

### SECTION 22: NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF ACCOUNTS

### SECTION 24: APPLICABLE LAW

By visiting CloudFlare.com, you agree that the laws of the United States and, specifically, those of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and CloudFlare or its affiliates. Any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be adjudicated in San Francisco County, California, USA.

### SECTION 25: ARBITRATION

In the case of any disputes under this Agreement, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve their dispute informally, or by means of commercial mediation, without the necessity of a formal proceeding.

Any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, which cannot otherwise be resolved as provided above shall be resolved by arbitration conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitral tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator mutually agreed by the parties, or in the absence of such agreement within thirty (30) calendar days from the first referral of the dispute to the AAA, designated by the AAA. The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, California, U.S.A., unless the parties shall have agreed to another location within fifteen (15) calendar days from the first referral of the dispute to the AAA. The arbitral award shall be final and binding. The parties waive any right to appeal the arbitral award, to the extent a right to appeal may be lawfully waived. Each party retains the right to seek judicial assistance: (i) to compel arbitration; (ii) to obtain interim measures of protection prior to or pending arbitration, (iii) to seek injunctive relief in the courts of any jurisdiction as may be necessary and appropriate to protect the unauthorized disclosure of its proprietary or confidential information, and (iv) to enforce any decision of the arbitrator, including the final award.

The arbitration proceedings contemplated by this Section shall be as confidential and private as permitted by law. To that end, the parties shall not disclose the existence, content or results of any proceedings conducted in accordance with this Section, and materials submitted in connection with such proceedings shall not be admissible in any other proceeding, provided, however, that this confidentiality provision shall not prevent a petition to vacate or enforce an arbitral award, and shall not bar disclosures required by law.
